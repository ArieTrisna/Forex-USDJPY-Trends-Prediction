# ðŸ“ˆ Forex USDJPY Trend Prediction  
*A Machine Learning approach to predicting forex price movement using Python*

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project aims to **predict the price trend (up or down)** of the USD/JPY forex currency pair using a **classification model** built with Python and scikit-learn. It demonstrates the full data science pipeline from data acquisition to deployment and is designed to showcase skills in **data cleaning, feature engineering, machine learning, and app development**.
